## Architecture & Key Components

### Current Structure
The repository is being initialized. Key directories to establish:
- `/src` - Source code for portfolio application
- `/docs` - Documentation, learning logs, and portfolio content
- `/config` - Configuration files for build/deployment
- `/tests` - Test suites for the project

### Expected Patterns
- **Portfolio entries**: Structured records of learning experiences
- **Competency tracking**: Documentation of skills developed
- **Reflection**: Structured reflection on work activities

- Use consistent competency naming across documents
- Track progression (novice → competent → proficient)

### Documentation
- Keep README files synchronized with project structure
- Maintain separate logs for different learning areas
- Use clear hierarchical structure for nested concepts

### Build/Deployment
- *(To be configured)*

### Version Control Conventions
- Branch naming: `feature/`, `bugfix/`, `docs/`
- Commit messages: Start with verb (Add, Fix, Update, Document, etc.)
- PR descriptions should link to learning outcomes

## Questions for Project Setup

**To be clarified:**
1. What technology stack will this portfolio use (web app, PDF documents, mobile app, etc.)?
2. Which PXL competency framework version should be followed?
3. Are there specific attendance/progress tracking requirements?
4. Will this integrate with PXL's learning management system?
5. What are the deployment requirements (GitHub Pages, custom server, etc.)?
